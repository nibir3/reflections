How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It just shows you the differences and the old vs new content of the file, so you can focus on what has changed
You won't miss any difference because you'll get all them as result of the command, and you can run it again
to double check that the file has been reviewed according to what you expect

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to start using in my personal projects in github

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps you to see the evolution in the code, and find when you introduced a bug. If you use it to blame who did it 
that is fine, but you should use is to learn on other errors and even from your own mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros - you can choose the way it works better for you

Cons - you don't get a consistend commit policy if you are not consistent on your decisions
