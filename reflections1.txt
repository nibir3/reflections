How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It just shows you the differences and the old vs new content of the file, so you can focus on what has changed
You won't miss any difference because you'll get all them as result of the command, and you can run it again
to double check that the file has been reviewed according to what you expect

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to start using in my personal projects in github
